\begin{abstract}
The Standard Model (SM) of physics has proven annoyingly successful in past decades, despite several measurements which hint at its incomplete description of nature.
The hunt for New Physics (NP) continues at higher energies ($>> 1 GeV$) with larger detectors ($\approx 10 kT$).
One such future detector is The Deep Underground Neutrino (DUNE) detector.
DUNE (as any beam detector) is a combination of two detectors, a near-detector (ND) and a far-detector (FD) for long-baseline neutrino oscillation measurements.
The DUNE FD will be a large scale ($\approx 40 kiloton$) Liquid Argon Time Projection Chabmer (LArTPC).
This 40-kT scale detector requires high precision in both timing ($<< \mu s$) and spatial resolutions ($\approx 1 mm$) for vertex reconstruction of interesting neutrino events.

This dissertation discusses recent progress and characterizations of a novel implementation of new a pixelated LArTPC readout technology.
This novel readout is based on a charge-integrate-reset circuit at the pixel level: Q-Pix.
We present the basic pixel level readout circuit and the implications such an implementation has when applied at kiloton LArTPC scales.
Further, we demonstrate results from the first-prototype implementation based on the Q-Pix readout which was designed with solely over-the-counter electronics.
One problem of any pixelated readout is the the ability to handle a large number of unique data channels, which in the DUNE-FD is $\approx 10^8$.
To address the scaling problem we developed and tested a modular digital back-end prototype as a proof of concept.
In this dissertation, we discuss nominal system requirements to achieve DUNE-FD APA scale for radiogenic background sensitivity, as well as pixel-level calibration techniques for both timing and charge.
Simulations were also performed based on projected radiogenic backgrounds and high-energy neutrino beam-line events which provide first estimates for the requirements of the digital back-end in both the quiescent and active states.
Finally, based on these results from the simulations and prototypes presented here we discuss the nominal digital back-end readout constraints of a fully realized Q-Pix implementation for a DUNE-FD APA~.
