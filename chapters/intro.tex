\chapter{Introduction}~\label{chap:intro}

The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate the viability of the digital back-end novel of a novel pixelated readout to be used in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). 
We begin this chapter with an introduction to the Standard Model (SM) in Section~\ref{sec:standard_model}.
We pay special attention to the experimental work that has been done to lay the foundation of the knowledge of physics that we have today.

In Section~\ref{sec:tpcs} we briefly discuss the history and development TPCs. 
The novel readout presented in this thesis is in Chapter~\ref{chap:qpix} is designed specifically for use in TPC detectors.
Chapter~\ref{chap:saq} provides the first measurements Q-Pix front-end readout in gas-based TPCs.

We continue in Section~\ref{sec:dune} to describe the future Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE).
The studies of Chapters~\ref{chap:qdb} and~\ref{chap:sim} demonstrate how this novel charge readout could be scaled to a DUNE Far Detector (DUNE-FD).

In Section~\ref{sec:neutrino_oscillation} we provide a brief history on the discovery of the neutrino and discuss its relevance for searching for physics beyond the Standard Model.
We also give a short review of the theory behind neutrino oscillations.
Oscillation measurements, and by extension, the search for Charge-Parity violation in the lepton sector, are a primary scientific goal of the DUNE experiment.
These measurements involve interactions that occur at~\unit{GeV} energy scales.
We provide the first demonstration of the required capabilities at these energy scales for the Q-Pix back-end readout in Chapter~\ref{chap:sim}.

\section{The State of Things: The Standard Model}~\label{sec:standard_model}

What is the universe made of?
What are the fundamental building blocks of matter?
Throughout history thinkers have questioned the nature of the universe and wondered what the basic building blocks of nature are.
Answering these fundamental questions is the motivation for particle physics.

In the history of science, it is easy to argue that the most successful of all models is the Standard Model of Physics.
The Standard Model (SM)~\citep{GLASHOW1961579, salam1964electromagnetic, weinberg1967model} was originally developed in the mid to late 1970's and is the model responsible for unifying the weak, strong, and electromagnetic forces together.
It has made remarkable predictions about the existence of elusive neutrinos, quarks and vector bosons before they were discovered, and more.

A comprehensive and extensive list of known particles, as well as various cross-sections, lifetimes, and other known information can be found from the bi-annually published Particle Data Group (PDG)~\citep{Workman:2022ynf}.
The SM has been tested experimentally more exhaustively than any other theory.
The SM has stood the test of time, despite the many mysteries it cannot explain.

\subsection{The Basics of the Standard Model}

The SM itself dictates the fundamental constituents of matter and energy.
Its purpose is to explain the origin of observed matter and to provide a description of all observable interactions.
The interactions described by the SM involve three of the four known fundamental forces observed in nature: the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces.
The missing fourth force is one of the major shortcomings of the SM: its inability to incorporate a quantum description of gravity.

All currently known fundamental particles are represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:cern_sm}.
These particles represent the today's knowledge of the building blocks of all observed matter in the universe.

\label{fig:cern_sm}
\end{figure}

The quarks represent particles in the upper left of Figure~\ref{fig:cern_sm}.
In 1961 Murray Gell-Mann proposed his ``eight-fold way''~\citep{eightfold_way_osti_4008239}, which provided a method of grouping the hadrons.
Shortly thereafter, the quark model was then proposed by Gell-Mann in 1964~\citep{quark_model_GELLMANN1964214}.
A unique feature of quarks compared to leptons is that no ``free'' quark has ever been observed.
This means that all current direct observations of quarks are in bound states.

The leptons represent particles in the lower left of Figure~\ref{fig:cern_sm}.
Like the quarks, the leptons come in three families (e, $\mu$, $\tau$).
Also like the quarks, the leptons have charge, mass, and flavor which means they can decay.
Unlike the quarks, the leptonic particles do not have a color quantum number and therefore do not combine together to form composite particles.

All forces within the SM (electromagnetism, weak, and strong) are governed via a ``carrier'' particle, known as a gauge boson.
These bosons are represented on the center-right of Figure~\ref{fig:cern_sm}.
Table~\ref{table:forces} provides a relative strength chart of the forces, and provides references for the first discovery of the carrier particle.

The strong-nuclear force is governed by the exchange of the gluon ($g$), and is described by Quantum-Chromodynamics (QCD).
This force is responsible for the color quantum numbers of matter and describes why nuclei are held together.
The electromagnetic force is governed by particle exchanges of a photon, and is described by Quantum-Electrodynamics (QED).
The neutrinos are the only particles within the quarks and leptons which do not interact at all with the electromagnetic force.
The weak-nuclear force is governed by particles exchanges of one of the three particles in the center: $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$.
This force involves a change in flavor of a particle, and affects both quarks and leptons.
It is also responsible for all nuclear decay processes.

The last particle to be discovered in Figure~\ref{fig:cern_sm} in the SM was the Higgs particle.
The Higgs particle was originally predicted in 1964 by Peter Higgs~\citep{HIGGS1964132}.
This particle is important to describe how mass is given to the elementary particles described by the SM.
The Higgs was discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\citep{higgs_discovery_20121}.

\subsection{Physics Beyond the Standard Model}

Despite the SMs many successes there is still much about the universe remains unexplained.
SM does not incorporate gravity, it does not account for the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe, nor does it account for sources of dark energy and dark matter.
SM also doesn't explain some of its fundamental properties, such as: why are there only three generations of leptonic particles (e, $\mu$, and $\tau$)?

The search for answers to these questions motivates the search for physics beyond the SM.
The success of the SM is also a sign of the difficulty of discovering new physics.
Likely, in order to push beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physicists will have to develop not only larger, but more clever detectors (Sect.~\ref{sec:dune}).
In Section~\ref{sec:neutrino_oscillation} we discuss another missed initial prediction of the SM: neutrino oscillations. 

\section{Time Projection Chambers}~\label{sec:tpcs}

The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) was first developed by David Nygren~\cite{lartpc:nygren} in 1974.
The first TPC design used high pressure gas and was able to measure thousands of particle tracks per second and provide full 3-D event reconstruction.
This detector was originally used in the Positron-Electron Project (PEP-4) experiment, which measured electron-positron collisions from the 29 GeV electron beam produced at the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC).

The basic operating principle of a TPC is that a charged, moving particle ionizes other particles in the detector and produces scintillation light.
The ionized electrons are then drifted by an external electric field down towards a collection plane (the anode) and are then readout by the electronics.
The electric field also prevents recombination of the ionized electrons in the medium. 
A diagram of this process is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dune_apa}.
The detected scintillation photons (not shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dune_apa}) can used to determine the time of the interaction.
The track of the ionizing particle can then be reconstructed using the 2-D information from the wires, the timing collected from the photons, and the drift time of the electrons.

\begin{figure}[]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/dune_tdrv12020_lartpc-sp.jpg}
\caption{Image of a Time Projection Chamber (TPC).
Charge is accumulated within the volume as ions are removed from the fiducial volume from another charged ion as it passes through the material.
An uniform electric field drifts the freed electrons towards the anode plane.
The collection and readout of charge on this anode plane is what is recorded within the detector.
Shown in the image are the three wire collection planes used in the DUNE experiment.
Image is taken from~\citep{DUNE_TDR_V1_Abi_2020}.}
\label{fig:dune_apa}
\end{figure}

The development of the TPC closely followed the development of fast (> 1~\unit{MHz}) digitizing electronics.
Using fast digitizers and closely spaced wires Georges Charpak (1924-2010) created the first multi-wire proportional chamber (MWPC) in 1968~\citep{Charpak:1968kd}.
Current and future TPCs~(see Section~\ref{sec:dune}) use MWPC as a basis for their readout electronics.

TPCs have proven to be extremely capable in high energy physics experiments.
They are used in many applications such as dark matter experiments~\citep{Aprile_2017_xenon1T} and neutrino experiments~\citep{MicroBooNE_Acciarri_2017}.
TPCs are so useful because provide high resolution in both temporal and spatial dimensions, as well as offer 3-D track reconstruction.
% An example of the energy resolution and particle-identification capabilities of TPCs is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pep4_tpc_dedex}.

\subsection{Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers}~\label{sec:lartpcs}

Alternatives to gaseous TPCs are liquid TPCs, which (as the name implies) uses a liquid detection medium.
A specific type of liquid based TCP is a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC)~\citep{rubbia1977liquid}.
Liquid was originally proposed as an alternative to the gaseous TPCs to provide a denser active volume.
Experiments such as neutrino or dark matter measurements have low interaction cross sections, and thus greatly benefit from a dense active detector medium.
Recently, much progress has been made in the implementation of LArTPCs for neutrino experiments (\citep{ArgoNeuT_PhysRevD.99.012002, MicroBooNE_Acciarri_2017, LArIAT_Acciarri_2020}).

LArTPCs provide a stable noble element (argon) with a high nucleon density.
Argon offers several key advantages for its selection as a detector medium.
Some key advantages of argon are its ability to produce large ($\sim$ 10kT) detectors, its high breakdown voltage, and its high ionization and scintillation yields.
The relevant properties of a LArTPC are shown in Table~\ref{tab:lar_prop}.

\section{The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment}~\label{sec:dune}

The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a long-baseline neutrino beam experiment~\citep{DUNE_TDR_V1_Abi_2020, DUNE_FD_TDRv2_2020, DUNE_TDRv3_Abi_2020, DUNE-FD_TDRv4:Abi_2020}.
DUNE, when constructed, will consist of two detectors, a near detector (ND) and a far detector (FD) which are separated by a distance of 1300 km.
The neutrino beam measured at the ND and FD will be generated at the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF)~\citep{dune_cdr_2016_arxiv} beamline at Fermilab.
An image of the beam and the ND are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dune_nd_beamline}.

The ND is located at Fermilab and its purpose is to characterize the unoscillated neutrino beam.
The ND serves as a control for DUNE's.
Results from the interaction rates at the ND provide evidence for the null hypothesis within the standard three neutrino oscillation paradigm.
It will measure the unoscillated spectra for $\nu_{e}, \nu_{\mu}$, and their anti-particle pairs as a function of their energy, upon which the oscillation probability depends.
The FD will use these unoscillated neutrino spectrum measurements to predict which neutrino interaction spectra it should measure.

\begin{figure}[]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/dune_nd_beamline_tdrv1.png}
\caption{Image of the near detector hall located relative to the neutrino beam at Fermilab in Illinois.

}
\label{fig:dune_nd_beamline}
\end{figure}

The ND is a suite of three detectors all exposed to a LBNF beam.
One component of the ND is a LArTPc (ND-LAr) which is a pixelated detector to be built using ArgonCube technology.
Another component of the ND is a high pressure (10~\unit{atm}) argon gas based TPC (ND-GAr).
The ND-Gar has superior identification capabilities of charged pions than the LArTPC, and prevents misidentification of these pions as protons.
The final component of the ND is the System for on-Axis Neutrino Detection (SAND), which is a magnetized beam monitor.
SAND is used to measure the beam flux sent to the FD.

\begin{figure}[]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/LBNE_Graphic_061615_2016.jpg}
\caption{Representation of the Near and Far Detectors for the DUNE experiment.
The ND is located within the image labeled as the Particle Detector.
One of the key purposes for the ND is to tag outgoing particles from the proton beam.
The FD is located at SURF on the left of the image, and will contain four 10 kT LArTPCs, which are the target of the neutrino beam.
The beam's energy and distance between the ND and FD are chosen to optimize sensitivity to neutrino oscillation measurements (See Section~\ref{sec:neutrino_oscillation}).
Image was taken from~\citep{dune_cdr_2016_arxiv}.}
\label{fig:dune_fd_image}
\end{figure}


The FD will be located underground at Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) and be approximately 1300 km away from the ND.
The FD will consist of four separate 10 kiloton LArTPC modules (DUNE-FD SP), an example of a single module is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dune_10kt}.
This detector represents an enormous engineering challenge to place such a large, cold, and complicated detector.

At least two of these four modules at least will use a known wire-based readout technology.
The remaining two modules are considered modules of opportunity and their readout technology is yet unknown.
A purpose of this dissertation is demonstrate the viability of a novel readout technology targeted at a large 10~\unit{kT} LArTPC Single-Phase (SP) module, which is discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:qpix}.

The ionization charges drift horrintally in the SP scheme, where electrons are drifted toward the anode (a) planes.

DUNE has three main science goals, all of which are geared towards pushing beyond the SM:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hadron Decay (Section~\ref{sec:hadron_decay})
    \item Core-collapse Supernovae (Section~\ref{sec:intro_supernova})
    \item Neutrino Oscillation (Section~\ref{sec:neutrino_oscillation})
\label{item:dune_props}
\end{itemize}

DUNE plans to offer an incredibly rich search in the areas listed above~\ref{item:dune_props}.
We will discuss the relevance of each of the first two items in the next two sections.
We provide a more complete discussion of neutrino oscillations in section~\ref{sec:neutrino_oscillation} because of its relevance to the results presented in chapter~\ref{chap:sim}.


\subsection{Hadron Decay}~\label{sec:hadron_decay}

Does a proton decay?
This is the fundamental question for physicists studying hadron decay.
The SM predicts that the proton itself is stable, so it should never decay.
Thus, the search for proton decay offers a path for physics beyond the SM.
Attempts to unify all the fundamental forces of nature into a single theory are called Grand Unified Theories (GUTs), and according to many GUTs, the proton does indeed decay.

Current measurements on the proton lifetime indicate that its lifetime is on the order of magnitude (or above) $10^{34}$ years.
Even at its most frequent, this is an exceedingly rare event considering that the lifetime of the universe is $\approx \mathcal{O}(10^{10}~\unit{yrs})$
Since these events are so rare, extremely large detectors with large numbers of protons inside of them are required to constantly observe many protons.
LArTPCs (as in DUNE) are excellent candidates for observing these rate events due to their active detector volume.
An example of a second generation proton decay study is the Imaging Cosmic and Rare Underground Signals (ICARUS) experiment~\citep{ICARUS_2001}.

There are at least two prominent decay chains that are expected to be dominant, depending on the Grand-Unification-Theory (GUT) that hopes to go beyond the SM.
The first one is:
\begin{equation}~\label{eq:rxn_proton_decay1}
  p^{+} \rightarrow e^{+} + \pi^{0} + 2 \gamma
\end{equation}


This interaction is easily detectable in cherenkov based detectors due to the emission of both the gammas as well as the high energy of the emitted positron.
In fact, the worlds best estimate for proton lifetime comes from this decay-chain~\citep{PhysRevD.95.012004}.

Other Supersymmetric GUT models predict instead~\citep{PhysRevD.38.1479}:
\begin{equation}~\label{eq:rxn_proton_decay2}
  p^{+} \rightarrow K^{+} + \nu
\end{equation}

In this case, the kaon generally moves too slowly to be measured by Cherenkov detectors.
However, TPC-based detectors are still sensitive to the charge deposited by it.
This is interesting because the Super-Kamiokande experiment, itself a Cherenkov-based detector in water, currently provides the world's best limits.

These searches are interesting, though difficult, in part because of the rarity of such an event.
If any detector could unambiguously measure even a single proton decay, it would provide direct evidence for physics beyond the SM.
Future detectors that will continue to search for nucleon decay are DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande, and JUNO~\citep{DUNE_TDR_V1_Abi_2020, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1805.04163, Juno:2022103927}.
These searches are interesting, if albeit difficult, both due to the rareness of such an eventJUNO~\citep{DUNE_TDR_V1_Abi_2020, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1805.04163, Juno:2022103927}.

\subsection{Supernova Studies}~\label{sec:intro_supernova}

A supernova occurs when a massive star runs out of the elemental fuel needed to fuel nuclear fusion at its core.
When this happens, the inward gravitational pull of the star's mass overcomes the reduced outward pressure from nuclear fusion.

It has been nearly 30 years since the last neutrinos were observed from a galactic core-collapse supernova, SN 1987A~\citep{1987ApJ...322..795F}.
The rarity of these events encourages large, precise, long-lived detectors to ensure a capture of neutrinos from the next event.
Sensitivity to supernova neutrinos is crucial for understanding the mechanisms that govern particles at these extreme densities and pressures.
Interestingly, because neutrinos are so weakly interacting, it is possible to observe their signature and arrival before the arrival of photons from a Type II supernova.


The principal interaction chain observable in a TPC is:
\begin{equation}
    \nu_{e} + ^{40}Ar \rightarrow e^- + ^{40}Kr^{+}

\section{Neutrinos and Oscillations}~\label{sec:neutrino_oscillation}

Evidence for the existence of neutrinos began in the early 20th century.
More than 100 years ago, Chadwick showed that the energy spectrum of a decaying electron was continuous~\citep{Chadwick:1914zz}.
This unknown cause of the spectrum even led some physicists to believe that the conservation of energy might be violated.
Wolfgang Pauli instead predicted that a particle he originally called the neutron would also be a decay product, but not easily observable.
This third particle in the decay would explain the energy spectrum of the electron.
The discovery of the neutron(\citep{Chadwick1932PossibleEO}) and the continuous spectrum of beta decay forced Pauli to come up with a new theory that attempted to describe beta decay~\citep{pauli_1934}.
Finally, some 26 years later, in 1956, the first observation of $\nu_{e}$~\citep{first_neutrino_measurement} was made.

Originally, the mass of the neutrino predicted by the SM was massless.
That was until the solar neutrino anomaly measured significantly fewer neutrinos than predicted~\citep{solar_neutrino_problem_PhysRevLett.20.1205}.
The solution was oscillation.
Since then, many large experiments have been devoted to measuring the three generations of neutrinos.

Neutrino oscillation describes the behavior that a neutrino can undergo a flavor transition as it moves through space.
The flavor transition relevant to DUNE is the transition of $\nu{\mu}\rightarrow \nu_{e}$ and its associated antiparticles. 
The flavor transition occurs because the mass and flavor eigenstates are not the same.
Here we give a general description of a model to describe neutrino oscillation.
We elucidate the measurable parameters that govern this oscillation and describe how these values are currently measured in experiments.
The standard notation refers to the mass eigenstates ($v_{i}$) and the flavor eigenstates ($v_{\alpha}$):
\begin{equation}~\label{eq:relate_eigenstates}
  v_{i} = U_{i\alpha}v_{\alpha}
\end{equation}

This can be expanded into matrxi notation as:
\begin{equation}~\label{eq:mass_eigenstates}
\begin{pmatrix}
\nu_e\\
\nu_{\mu}\\
\nu_{\tau}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
U_{e1}, U_{e2}, U_{e3} \\
U_{u1}, U_{u2}, U_{u3} \\
U_{\tau1}, U_{\tau2}, U_{\tau3}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\nu_1\\
\nu_2\\
\nu_3
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The matrix elements within $U_{li}$ represent the mixing coeffecients and are used to calculate the probability that a certain neutrino will oscillate from one family to another.
We identify $U_{ij}$ as the commonly known $U_{PMNS}$ matrix, where PMNS stands for: Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata, or the four theorists who helped developed this convention.
Luckily, there are not a total of nine free parameters within the SM that determine this.
The $U_{PMNS}$ matrix can be additionally rewritten following~\citep{Pontecorvo:1957qd, 1962PThPh..28..870M} as:

\begin{equation}~\label{eq:uij_matrix_simp}
U_{PMNS}
=
U_{sol} \times U_{rea} \times U_{atm} \times U_{maj}
\end{equation}

After expanding the matrix representations, Equation~\ref{eq:uij_matrix_simp} becomes:
\begin{equation}
U_{PMNS}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & C_{23} & S_{23} \\
0 & -S_{23} & C_{23} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\times
\begin{pmatrix}
C_{13} & 0 & S_{13}e^{-1\delta_{cp}} \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
-S_{13}e^{-1\delta_{cp}} & 0 & C_{13} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\times
\begin{pmatrix}
C_{12} & S_{12} & 0 \\
-S_{12} & C_{12} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\times
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 \\
e^{i\alpha_{1}} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & e^{i\alpha_{2}} & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

We identify above the additional matrix components where historically these values are measured.
Therefore, instead of nine unknown parameters for the SM, there are only six.
The components $C_{ij}$ and $S_{ij}$ in the matrices are defined to be $\cos(\theta_{ij})$ and $\sin(\theta_{ij})$, respectively.

Then, the six parameters of the $U_{PMNS}$ are identified as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\theta_{13}$ - Reactor measurements.
    \item $\theta_{12}$ - Atmospheric measurements.
    \item $\theta_{23}$ - Solar measurements.
    \item $\delta_{CP}$ - Charge-conjugation parity violation.
    \item $\alpha_{1}$/$\alpha_{2}$, The two Majorana Phase parameters, not observable in beam experiments.
\end{itemize}

The Majorana phases ($\alpha_{i}$) are sensitive in experiments that can detect the Majorana nature of neutrinos such as neutrinoless double beta decay.
In neutrino oscillation measurements, these phases cancel out and not not measurable.
Therefore, we can safely ignore these two phases for the work presented here.

Next we demonstrate the calculation of the probability of oscillation from one mass eigenstate to another.
We calculate the probability $P(\mu \rightarrow e)$, which is the probability of interest for the DUNE beam experiment.
First we identify that Equation~\ref{eq:relate_eigenstates} can be rewritten to isolate the flavor-eigenstate terms ($v_{\alpha}$) by multiplying by the adjoint of the PMNS matrix ($U^{*}_{PMNS}$).
Then the relationship between the time dependent mass and flavor eigenstates become:

\begin{equation}~\label{eq:flavor_relation}
\ket{v_{\alpha}(t)} = U^{*}_{PMNS}\ket{v_{i}(t)}
\end{equation}

The value of interest is $P(\mu \rightarrow e)$, which occurs if the $\nu_{\mu}$ travels after some time, t, and interacts via a charged-current (CC) interaction.
The probability to end up in state $v_{e}$ beginning from $v_{\mu}$ is:

\begin{equation}~\label{eq:prob_calc1}
P(\mu \rightarrow e) = \lvert \braket{ v_{e} | v_{\mu} (t) }\rvert^{2}
\end{equation}

We then use Equation~\ref{eq:flavor_relation} to represent the matrix elements of $U_{PMNS}$ from $v_{e}$ and $v_{\mu}$ to obtain~\citep{Nunokawa_2008}:
\begin{equation}~\label{eq:prob_calc2}
  P(\mu \rightarrow e)
  = \lvert \sum_{i} U_{e i} U^{*}_{\mu i} e^{-i E_{i}t} \rvert^{2} \\
  = \lvert 2U^{*}_{\mu 3}U_{e3}\sin \Delta_{31}e^{-i\Delta_{32}} 2U^{*}_{\mu 2}U_{e2}\sin \Delta_{21} \rvert^{2}
\end{equation}

Where we identify that the cross terms of the exponential introduce a phase difference shown as $\Delta_{ij}$ in the second term in Equation~\ref{eq:prob_calc2}.
We also substituted $E_{i}t = m^{2}_{i}L/2E$, to express the oscillation parameter in terms of distance traveled, L.
Then, the Equation~\ref{eq:prob_calc2} represents the probability of a $\nu_{\mu}$ to interact via a produce a flavor-changing CC interaction after traveling some distance L.

Finally, the last parameters which govern the neutrino oscillations are identified as the mass differences between the three mass states ($\Delta_{ij}$).
These two mass-squared differences are represented in Figure~\ref{fig:mass_hierarchy}.
We note that the though there are three combinations of $\Delta_{ij}$ there are only two independent parameters, which are conventionally known as $\Delta_{12}$ and $\Delta_{23}$.
$\Delta_{12}$ is the term which governs the oscillation from the neutrinos in the sun, which are mostly originally $\nu_{e}$ and flavor change to $\nu_{\mu}$.
By the similar reasoning, $\Delta_{13}$, is referred to as atmospheric, since it describes the neutrino oscillations normally observed from atmospheric neutrinos, which flavor change into a $\nu_{\tau}$.
Unfortunately, since the value of the squared mass-difference is measured ($\Delta_{12}^{2}$ and $\Delta_{13}^{2}$), it is not known which mass eigenstate of the neutrinos is the heaviest.

The sign uncertainty leads to two possible orderings of the masses, known as normal (NO) and inverted (IO) order.
NO indicates that the masses of the neutrinos follow the ordering of their charged partners.
That is, NO implies a mass ordering of: $\nu_{1} < \nu_{2} < \nu_{3}$.
Whereas, IO has a mass ordering: $\nu_{3} < \nu_{2} < \nu_{2}$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mass_hierarchy}.

\caption{Representation of the mass hierarchy scales. This is a representation of the two possible orderings of neutrino masses, due to the uncertain sign of $m_{13}$. It is also interesting to observe that the absolute mass scale is not measured since oscillation measurements only give difference mass squares. Image was taken from~\citep{QIAN20151}.}

Neutrino oscillations in matter exhibit slight deviations compared to those in a vacuum~\citep{PhysRevD.17.2369}.
The Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect~\citep{Smirnov2004TheME} further contributes to the differentiation of neutrino oscillations as they traverse through regions of varying matter density, introducing additional complexity to the calculations.
The MSW effect plays a crucial role in the DUNE experiment as it affects neutrinos and anti-neutrinos differently, providing valuable insights for the measurement of $\delta_{cp}$.
In beam-line experiments, this resonance effect primarily influences electron neutrinos ($\nu_{e}$) in the case of normal mass ordering (NO), resulting in enhanced neutrino flavor conversion.
Conversely, in the case of inverted mass ordering (IO), the antineutrino counterpart ($\hat{\nu_{e}}$) experiences resonance, making flavor transformation more probable for ($\nu_{e}$).

% %% antihydrogen
% \citep{Sadowski_2017}
% Another driving factor is the the development of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, particularly Convectional Neural Network (CNN \citep{Sadowski2017DeepLI}).
% Recent industry has driven the need for CNNs to be able to correctly identify and label 2-D images of various kinds, and thus championed much of progress in this field and spawned many kinds of CNN algorithms.

% %% cite sadowski here
% Recently, it has been shown how these kinds of algorithms extend into High Energy Physics (HEP) for particle identification.
% A major issue at the Intensity Frontier of physics is the sheer amount of data to store and process.
% These ML algorithms provied a developed tool to automate the analysis of huge amounts of data ($>> 1 TB$) and have been shown to be quite accurate ($>99\%$) at particle identification in LArTPCs.


% %% LArPix / Argon Cube
% Additional work has been performed in recent years which show that LArTPCs can also utilized a pixel-based readout~\citep{larpix:Dwyer_2018}, \citep{Asaadi_2018}.

% The end of the Standard Model era is inevitable.
% SM simply fails to account for physics with all major frontiers for physicists to accept its completeness; we know there is much and more to learn about nature.

% The 20th century saw unprecedented progress in its sophistication of its detectors from ray tubes, to spark chambers, to proportional counters, and to huge (>20 km) particle accelerators.
% This century shows no signs holding any less promise than its predecessor.
% Continued development in electronics, computing, and analysis methods will lead to more and newer frontiers of physics.

% The work presented in this introduction aims to not only encapsulate the massive progress particle physics has made since the electron's discovery, but also to server as a reminder of how extraordinarily surprising nature is.
% At every turn and at every point where physicists think they've arrived at the end (or at an impossible roadblock) there always remains more to discover.
% If we have learned anything, we have learned to knock and the door shall be opened.

% More detailed descriptions of such collider experiments are beyond the scope of the work presented here, and further reading may be pursued from the extremely detailed technical design reports cited here of Belle-II and the ATLAS experiments.
% The LHC itself consists of other large-scale tracking and calioremtry experiments such as ATLAS~\citep{ATLAS:1999vwa} and CMS~\citep{CMS:2006myw}.
% There exist lepton collidors~\citep{belle2_tdr_arxiv} which offer unique areas of search along this frontier too.
