%% heading for this chapter
This chapter outlines and highlights useful background that will be explored in further detail in upcoming chapters as well as provides an outline for the thesis.
We begin with an introduction on the standard model, and how both its success and short comings drive larger and more expensive detectors at the intensity frontier.
To elucidate the issues at the forefront of the standard model we provide a brief history, with an emphasis on the detectors and experiments which lead to its formulation.
Next, we become more specific and discuss DUNE which is an example of a new, large, and expensive detector which aims to push beyond the Standard Model.
Finally, we relate the work presented in this dissertation is based on TPCs and how the novel readout design used here is suited for future expansion into larger detectors.

%% Where we are
\section{The State of Things: The Standard Model}

%% what is the SM: Summarize what it does well and what it doesn't do well
In the history of science, it is easily argued that the most successful of all models has been the Standard Model of physics.
The standard model was originally developed in mid to late 1970's, and is the model responsible for unifying the weak, strong, and electromagnetic forces together.
It has been made remarkable predictions about the existance of elusive neutrinos, and an extensive number of other particles.

%% elaborate more here on the standard model, what is it really?

Yet, despite its numerous achievements in predictive power and experimental verification we know today that it has crucial shortcomings. 
The Standard Model (SM) has no ability to account for Dark Matter or Dark Energy in the universe, nor the distribution (or the hierarchy) of neutrino masses, nor is it able to relate how gravity interacts with the other fundamental forces of nature (Unification).
It also doesn't account for some 'basic' properties it has, such as: why are there only three generations of laptonic particles (electron, muon, and tau)?
These short-comings offer hints for where to search for physics.
Physicists have known about these short comings from the conception of the Standard Model and have (to no avail) sought out what's next.

With a plethora of hints to search for NP, it can be useful to organize the efforts of search.
In 2008 the p5 committee did just this and labeled the three frontiers of physics as the cosmological, energy, and intensity frontiers.
Each of these frontiers offer different kinds of challenges and aim to search at the

%% cosmological frontier problems
The cosmological frontier aims to search for NP on extremely large time and distance scales by relying on observational techniques.
Cosmological measurements have shown the that majority of the universe's matter is not visible to light, and so we call it dark matter.
Additionally, the unverise is expanding at an accelerated rate, which we can tell from the blueshift of distance galaxies.
Likewise, cosmologists have also discovered that the universe is expanding due to some invisible energy in the universe, and so we call it dark energy.
The search for these dark causes of the universe lie within the realm of the cosmological frontier.

%% energy frontier problems
The energy frontier is concerned with the origin of mass.
The Large-Hadron Collider experiment is the archetypal experiment aimed at solving problems within this frontier.

%% intensity frontier problems (and the focus of this thesis)
The third (and final) frontier to mention is the Intensity frontier.
The Intensity Frontier of Physics (\citep{intensityfrontier2012_Hewett}) is one which requires very large and very precise measurements to gain the statistics to declare an observation.
In order to address the issues posed within this frontier the large scale detectors hunting for New Physics (NP) have continued to grow in size, energy sensitivity, and importantly cost: \citep{Juno:2022103927}.


%% how we got here
\section{How we got here.}

Many times since the early 20th century it was thought that the goal of physics was accomplished.
% Even during Max Plank's time (1858-1947) physics he was told (according to Planck himself) was nearly a complete and mature science, such a geometry.
However, during each of these moments of false triumph some new detector was built to take a new measurement; thus, the door to new understanding of nature is never shut.
This section provides a brief and (necessarily) incomplete history of significant measurements and detector developments relevant to particle physics.
In order to clear an obstacle, it is often helpful to remember the previous ones.


\subsection{A Century of new Detectors}

At the turn of the 20th century particle physics was in its infancy.
In 1900 Max Planck first introduces the concept of energy quanta for the first time concerning photons to eliminate the infamous ultra-violet catastrophe problem introduced by statistical mechanics.
JJ Thomson used a single cathode-ray tube to discover the electron and the nucleus, and won for himself the Nobel Pize in 1906.
Milikan's famous oil-drop experiment won him the Nobel Prize in 1923.

However, as each of these new discoveries solved problems only more questions were produced.
Once the nucleus was discovered to contain only protons and neutrons, the natural question arose: what holds all of the positive charge together in the center.
Thus, physicists cleverly named the new force which was stronger than the electromagnetic force: the Strong Force.

The bubble chamber was then invented in 1952 by Donald Glaser~\citep{bubbleChamber_PhysRev.87.665}.
These detectors proved significant in the discover of the W and Z bosons and ultimately allowed the unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces to form the electroweak theory.

Next the spark chamber eventually lead to the gradual development of the wire-spark chamber.
In 1968 Georges Charpak developed the Multi-Wire Proportional Chamber (MWPC) for which he (much later) won the Nobel Prize in 1992.
From this key insight a new detector concept was made possible.

\subsubsection{Time Projection Chambers}

Time Projection Chambers (TPC)~\citep{lartpc:nygren} have been shown to be extremely useful in high energy physics experiments due, in part, to their high resolution in both timing and spatial dimensions.
This detector was originally used in the Position-Electron Project PEP-4 experiment which measured electron-positron collisions from the 29 GeV electron beam produced at the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC).
The first TPC design used high pressure gas and was able to measure 1000s of particle tracks per second (compared to 1-10) and provide full 3-D event reconstruction.


It did not take long for other experimentalists to generalize this concept to different elements or even to liquid.


\subsubsection{Noble Gases and Time Projection Chambers}

The technology of TPCs has greatly matured since their original inception.
in many kinds of detectors across HEP. TPCs can also incorporate two phases of a substance (liquid and gas), called Dual Phase (DP) TPCs.

the Xenon-1T is a dark matter experiment which is a dual-phase TPC \citep{Aprile_2017_xenon1T}.

The LUX experiment is a single phase TPC also hunting for dark matter.


A specific kind of TCP is a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) \citep{rubbia1977liquid}.

%% include relevant LArTPCs here
recent work on LArTPCs (\citep{ArgoNeuT:PhysRevD.99.012002}, \citep{MicroBooNE:Acciarri_2017}, \citep{LArIAT:Acciarri_2020}).


Energy resolution of the LArTPCs within DUNE are still unknown to within a factor of 4 \citep{lartpc_energy_resolution:PhysRevD.99.036009}.



\subsection{An Escape: Catch the Neutrino}

More than 100 years ago in 1899 Ernest Rutherford observed beta decay.
Not too long afterward it was determined that the energy spectrum of the electrons resulting from this decay produced a spectrum.
This even lead some physicists to belief that perhaps the conservation of energy was violated.
However, the motivation to save this conservation law lead Wolfgang Pauli to the first prediction (1930) of the neutrino; the reason that the energy was a spectrum from the electron was that some of the energy was ``taken up'' by the neutrino.
Finally, some 26 years later in 1956 was the first observation of the electron neutrino~\citep{first_neutrino_measurement}.


After this first discovery is when the the answers, and mostly the questions started to pile in.

\section{The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment}

The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a long-baseline neutrino beam experiment \cite{DUNE_TDR_V1_Abi_2020, DUNE_FD_TDRv2_2020, DUNE_TDRv3_Abi_2020, DUNE-FD_TDRv4:Abi_2020}. 
DUNE is composed two detectors, a near (ND) and a far (FD) which are separated by a distance of 1300 km. 
The ND is located at Fermilab and its purpose is to characterize the source neutrino beam created there.
The FD is composed of four separate 10 kiloton modules, all of which will be a single-phase (SP) LArTPC based detector.
Two of these four modules at least will use a known wire-based readout technology and a vertical drift-readout.
The two remaining modules are considered modules of opportunity and their readout technology is yet unknown.
A purpose of this dissertation is show the viability of a novel readout technology.

\caption{Simple Draw up of DUNE FD taken from \citep{dune_cdr_2016_arxiv}}
\end{figure}

DUNE has three main science goals, all of which are geared towards pushing beyond the standard model:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hadron Decay
    \item Neutrinos from Core-collapse supernovae
    \item Beamline neutrino interactions.
\end{itemize}

We will discuss the relevance of each of these items, and in \ref{chap:qpix} we will further discuss how the work presented here relates to each of these topics. 


Conventional horizontal drift detection for foreseeable DUNE modules are already considered possible for lengths up to 6.5m \citep{DUNE_Vertical:Paulucci_2022}.

% extra-dimensional gauge bosons

\subsection{Neutrino Oscillation}

Of all known particles the most elusive (hardest to detect and measure) is the neutrino.
For this reason the least is known about the neutrino.
What we do know about the neutrino is there are three pairs of them, associated with their leptonic partners: the electron, muon, and tau.

It came as a welcome shock that neutrino oscillation was first measured.
This oscillation indicates that a neutrino as it moves through space can change its state; a electron neutrino can oscillate into a muon neutrino or even a tau neutrino.
This happens because the mass eigenstate and flavor eigenstates which govern the neutrino are not equal.

\subsection{Pixelated Detectors in the Current Century}

Finally, in this last section we discuss recent progress of various detector technologies moving towards pixelization.
There are many motivating pressures for new detectors to adopt pixelated designs. 
Below we discuss two contributing factors: the development of electronics and computing algorithms.

First, previously pixelated detectors have historically been more difficult because of the issues of cost and size regarding the number of readout channels.
This is being addressed, in part, by the advent of newer, cheaper, and larger Field-Programmable-Gate Arrays (FPGAs).
One method for reducing the electronic overhead required in pixelated detectors is to use digital multiplexing.
Cheap, high channel FPGAs directly solve this problem. 
Other electronics development, such as the Silicon-Photomultiplier, offer much cheaper alternatives for large pixel counters compared to their historical counter-parts. 

%% antihydrogen
\citep{Sadowski_2017}
Another driving factor is the the development of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, particularly Convectional Neural Network (CNN \citep{Sadowski2017DeepLI}). 
Recent industry has driven the need for CNNs to be able to correctly identify and label 2-D images of various kinds, and thus championed much of progress in this field and spawned many kinds of CNN algorithms. 
%% cite sadowski here
Recently, it has been shown how these kinds of algorithms extend into High Energy Physics (HEP) for particle identification.
A major issue at the Intensity Frontier of physics is the sheer amount of data to store and process. 
These ML algorithms provied a developed tool to automate the analysis of huge amounts of data ($>> 1 TB$) and have been shown to be quite accurate ($>99\%$) at particle identification in LArTPCs.
