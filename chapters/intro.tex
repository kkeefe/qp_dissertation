\section{BSM Physics}

Large Scale detectors hunting for New Physics (NP) have continued to grow in size, energy sensitivity, and importantly cost: [\citep{Juno:2022103927}].

%% Motivating Source of TPCs
\section{Time Projection Chambers}

Time Projection Chambers (\citep{lartpc:nygren}) have been shown to be extremely useful in high energy physics experiments due, in part, to their high resolution in both timing and spatial dimensions.

A specific kind of TCP is a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) \citep{rubbia1977liquid}.

%% include relevant LArTPCs here
recent work on LArTPCs (\citep{ArgoNeuT:PhysRevD.99.012002}, \citep{MicroBooNE:Acciarri_2017}, \citep{LArIAT:Acciarri_2020}).

Energy resolution of the LArTPCs within DUNE are still unknown to within a factor of 4 \citep{lartpc_energy_resolution:PhysRevD.99.036009}.

Additional work has been performed in recent years which show that LArTPCs can also utilized a pixel-based readout \citep{larpix:Dwyer_2018}, \citep{Asaadi_2018}.

%% Highlight what DUNE is and its purpose
\section{DUNE}

Conventional Horizontal Drift Dectors \citep{DUNE-FD:Abi_2020}.

Conventional horizontal drift detection for forseeable DUNE modules are already considered possible for lengths up to 6.5m \citep{DUNE_Vertical:Paulucci_2022}.
