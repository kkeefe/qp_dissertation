\section{Background Rates and Calibration}

sources of backgrounds are taken from \citep{DUNE-FD_TDRv4:Abi_2020}

\section{Supernova Studies}

Work has been done to understand how a Q-Pix based DUNE-FD would measure core collapse supernovae \citep{qpix:shion}.

Simulation studies which involved particle interactions were based on Geant4 \citep{geant4:AGOSTINELLI2003250}.
