In this chapter we describe the overall structure of the digital back-end of the Q-Pix design as well as results from prototype board tests.
As described in previous chapters, the digital back-end of the Q-Pix readout is composed of an array of ASICs (FPGAs, here), which we refer to here to as digital nodes.
Each digital node in the prototype array is implemented as a lattice ice40UP5k FPGA.

This chapter is divided into two parts.
The first part we give a detailed description of the requirements of a successful deployment digital-system in a Q-Pix based detector at DUNE APA scales.
The motivation is to describe how the digital backend of Q-Pix based readout would eventually scale into a DUNE-FD LArTPC 10 kT module.

The second part of this chapter is dedicated to the first evaluation boards developed and tested which implement the digital nodes in Lattice iCE40UP FGPAs~\citep{lattice_ice40up_datasheet}.
The second part also outlines the design of the PCB on which these FPGAs are implemented, as well as results, which are motivated from the first part of this chapter.

The Lattice Semiconductor FPGAs \citep{lattice_ice40up_datasheet} were selected because of the small form factor, pin out, availability, as well as low power consumption.
There are planned tests for future, but not presented here, to indicate its viability of over-the-counter FPGAs in LArTPc.
If such cheap and available FPGAs were shown to be reliable use in a LArTPC environment, that could influence future detector development and the selection of the digital chip for the Q-Pix readout.

All results presented in this chapter are my own individual work.
