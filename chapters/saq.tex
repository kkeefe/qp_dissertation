In this chapter we introduce the first implementation of the Q-Pix based design using purely "over-the-counter" electronics.

Measurements of Transverse and Longitudinal diffusion of electrons within electric fields of strength 500 V/cm have been performed before \citep{lar_diffusion_measurement_LI2016160}.
