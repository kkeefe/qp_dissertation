In this chapter we introduce a novel readout technology at the pixel level for LArTPCs. 
The basic readout circuit was first introduced by \citep{qpix:nygren:mei}.

\section{Qpix Design}

Concept of this combined ASIC and reducing the number of channels relies on digital multiplexing.

This differs from other concepts such as Genetic Multiplexing (\citep{PROCUREUR2013888_genetic_multiplexing}) and using only regions of interest (ROI).

sources of backgrounds are taken from \citep{DUNE-FD:Abi_2020}

\section{Supernova Studies}

Work has been done to understand how a Q-Pix based DUNE-FD would measure core collapse supernovae \citep{qpix:shion}.

Simulation studies which involved particle interactions were based on Geant4 \citep{geant4:AGOSTINELLI2003250}.
